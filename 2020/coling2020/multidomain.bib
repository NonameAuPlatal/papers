We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks. Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully parallelized during training to better exploit the GPU hardware and optimization is easier since the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of Wu et al. (2016) on both WMTâ€™14 English-German and WMTâ€™14 English-French translation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.}

        Abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of existing multi-domain learning approaches with respect to two questions. First, many multi-domain learning algorithms resemble ensemble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain learning improvements the result of ensemble learning effects? Second, these algorithms are traditionally evaluated in a balanced label setting, although in practice many multi-domain settings have domain-specific label biases. When multi-domain learning is applied to these settings, (2) are multi-domain methods improving because they capture domain-specific class biases? An understanding of these two issues presents a clearer idea about where the field has had success in multi-domain learning, and it suggests some important open questions for improving beyond the current state of the art.},
